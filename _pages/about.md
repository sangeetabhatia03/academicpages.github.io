I am a PhD candidate at Western Sydney University in Sydney, Australia. I have submitted my PhD thesis in January 2017 and at the moment, awaiting the dreaded examiners' reports. My PhD is in the esoteric field of Algebraic Biology. The elevator trip explanation is that I am working on building algebraic models for the ways in which large scale changes happen in an organism's genome.  Before moving to academia, I worked as a software engineer for around 5 years. 

# Research Interests
I am interested in probing biological systems using mathematical and computational tools. I've worked on a wide range of topics - from phylogenetics using algebraic methods to studying pain response using a convolution model. I'm always looking for exciting problems in the field of mathematical biology. 

Another area in which I like to dabble is the use of the web to illuminate complex ideas. I am an amateur web developer and like to play around with D3, Leaflet and other javascript toys in my spare time.

# Outreach
I love talking about my work (who doesn't?) and about science and maths in general. I've been involved in a number of outreach activities with school kids of various ages.
